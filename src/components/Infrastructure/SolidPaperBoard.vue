              Solid Paper Board Packaging Project: The Solid Paper Board
              Packaging is a project implemented by SUS own fund. Earlier it was
              funded by the Australian Agency for International Development
              (AUS/AID).<br /><br />
              This project is being implemented in Savar Upazila of Dhaka
              district with the profit earned through sale proceeds. The main
              objective of this project is to create a resource base of the
              organization for its sustainability and also create job
              opportunity for the poor and distressed women group members.<br /><br />
              The activities of this project are: making sweetmeat, sharees
              (women wear) and foot wear boxes by solid paperboard and selling
              these boxes to different shops at and around Savar and Dhaka City.
