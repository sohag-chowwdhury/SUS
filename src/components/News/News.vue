In this case, we prepared colourful, pictorial and message bearing leaflets designed by our own staff members and circulated accordingly among the mass people in the SUS working areas. We also hanged up banners containing precautionary message regarding COVID-19 at the crowded places. ",

            "Dissemination of clear instruction to the field staff: Written instructions were passed to the field staff clearly specifying precautionary measures to be taken for the virus. In this case, we shared a complete guideline supplied by the PKSF among the SUS employees",

Not only that our field staff members are also communicating with the beneficiary groups of SUS so that they do not feel isolated and think that SUS is with them. Further, the field situation is being continuously monitored by means of gathering all relevant information and using data software installed in each program office of the organization",

            "Stoppage of loan classification: Immediately after receiving announcement / decree issued by the Microcredit Regulatory Authority (MRA) in Bangladesh, our organization has stopped classification of loans. This means that the default clients will not be classified as defaulters and their borrower status will not change. The borrowers will not have to pay any loan installment for the period up to September 2020. But they can pay installments only if they want and in that case, there will be no obligation and restriction.",
